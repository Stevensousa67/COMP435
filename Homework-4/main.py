Objective: This project is an implementation of Radix Sort. This is accomplished by either using Counting Sort or
Bucket Sort. It is assumed that the maximum length of the numbers to be sorted is 4 digits. If using Counting Sort,
the digit range is between 0 and 9 included. If using Bucket Sort, there will be 10 buckets labeled 0 to 9.

Observations: Make sure all the dependencies of this project are together in order for it to work. Program operates
accomplished the desired outcome.

Instructions: Run the program and follow the prompts. You will be asked to provide a sequence of numbers to be sorted
and then select which method you would like to use (Counting Sort or Bucket Sort) and the program will apply the correct
sorting method to your sequence, displaying the sorted sequence at the end.
